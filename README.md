### Improving Android: location privacy protection and energy consumption

Android, main operating system of smartphones sold throughout the world, allows its users
many actions: phone calls, messages sending, web browsing, applications downloads...
The latter are not always respectful of their users privacy, and can learn more information than
they ask for thanks to locations; in this context, we present an application allowing users to know
who tracks them, information known about them, and finally protect their privacy.

In an rich ecosystem with millions of applications whose two-thirds of the source code consists
in calls to external libraries, it is important to monitor their functioning, to be able to choose the
most efficient: we propose to compare libraries among the most used by developers.
